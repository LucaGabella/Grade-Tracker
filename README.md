GRADE TRACKER

I created this grade tracker with the idea of keeping track of my grades in each of my modules over the course of my degree. 
It allowed be to upload modules, assignments and exams with the grades achieved and the weighting on each one, I was also able to add a grade goal for each module.
With all of these taken into account, it will tell me my current grade achieved and what I needed to achieve in the remaining assignments to achieve my goal.

Once the total weight of assignments reaches 100%, it will no longer allow the addition of new assignments, if they all had grades it will tell you the final grade in the given module.

ChatGPT was used in the assistance of getting to grips with tkinter as a Python library I hadn't used before. It also assisted in the debugging of some of the more complicated functions.
